description: "Create reproducible analyses, use version control, document code, and establish collaboration workflows"
phase_order: 3
sidebar: open-research-cycle

This phase focuses on creating reproducible, well-documented analyses that can be understood and verified by collaborators and the broader research community.

## a. Reproducible Data Analysis

Data processing and analysis should be **reproducible**, meaning others can rederive your results on a different computer. This is most easily achieved by:

- **Avoiding point-and-click processes** (which can't be traced)
- **Using programming/scripting** (which creates a traceable record)
- **Documenting your workflow** thoroughly

::: {.callout-note}
Your scripts and analyses are dynamic—they will change due to error corrections, new ideas, and feedback. Process automation saves time when making revisions.

### Version Control with Git

Use **Git** to track every change to your files:

- Each change is recorded with a meaningful commit message
- You can revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborate with others without overwriting work
- Maintain a complete history of your project

**Best practices:**

- Use platforms like **GitHub** (for public projects) or **GitLab** (for secure, private projects)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Commit frequently with logical changesets
- Never commit sensitive data

### Reproducible Workflows in R

If using R, each project should:

- Be based on an **RStudio project** (.Rproj file)
- Follow a **standard folder structure**
- Use **relative paths** (not absolute paths)
- Use **renv** for package management
- Be under **Git version control**

### Writing Readable Code

Your code should be:

- **Structured**: Use clear organization and logical flow
- **Commented**: Explain *why* you made decisions (not just *what* the code does)
- **Styled**: Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., using `styler` or `lintr` for R)
- **Modular**: Create functions to avoid code duplication
- **Reproducible**: Set seeds for random number generation

## No Sensitive Information in Code
Never include passwords, patient information, or other sensitive data in code comments or scripts.

## b. Data Dictionaries & README Files

::: {.callout-tip}
## Learn More
[FAIR Data Management](https://lmu-osc.github.io/FAIR-Data-Management/) (2h tutorial)
:::

**README files** and **data dictionaries** (codebooks) are crucial documentation:

### Data Dictionary

A data dictionary describes each variable in your dataset:

- Variable names
- Variable descriptions
- Data types
- Units of measurement
- Coding schemes (e.g., 1 = Male, 2 = Female)
- Missing value codes

### README File

A README explains how to use your repository:

- Project overview and purpose
- Directory structure
- How to run the code (in what order)
- Software dependencies
- Data sources and citations
- Contact information

Start these documents early and update them regularly—first for your own use, then for your team, and finally for external users before publication.

## c. Literate Programming

::: {.callout-tip}
## Learn More
- [Literate programming with Quarto](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-Quarto/) (2.5h)
- [Reference management with Zotero](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-zotero/) (1h)
:::

**Literate programming** alternates plain language (e.g., English) with programming code to provide context to results, tables, and figures.

With tools like **Quarto**, you can create:

- Reproducible presentations
- Dynamic reports
- Executable manuscripts
- Project websites

**Benefits:**

- Results and figures automatically update when code changes
- Combines narrative text, code, and output in one document
- Can render to multiple formats (HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint)
- Integrates with reference managers like Zotero

Your analysis code should include a **Quarto reproducible report** that documents how results were generated. This facilitates:

- Reproducibility checks (sometimes required by journals)
- Code reuse by other researchers
- Easier collaboration and revision

## d. Code Repository Checklist

Before sharing your code repository, ensure it includes:

### Essential Components

- ✓ Standard folder structure
- ✓ Version control with Git (shared with team via GitLab/GitHub)
- ✓ Package management (e.g., renv for R projects)
- ✓ Raw and/or processed data (when appropriate)
- ✓ Descriptive README file
- ✓ Data dictionary/codebook
- ✓ Reproducible report (e.g., Quarto document)

### Code Quality

- ✓ Metadata/header identifying author and purpose
- ✓ Clear structure for readability
- ✓ Informative comments (without sensitive information)
- ✓ Meaningful, consistent naming conventions
- ✓ Style following language guidelines
- ✓ Functions to avoid code duplication
- ✓ Seeds set for reproducibility

### Checkpoint: Repository & Code Peer Review

Have your repository and code peer-reviewed by:

- A team member
- Your direct supervisor
- A code review specialist

Reviewers should check:

- **Functionality**: Does the code work as described?
- **Reproducibility**: Can results be reproduced on a different computer?
- **Clarity**: Is the code well-documented and understandable?
- **Best practices**: Does it follow established guidelines?
