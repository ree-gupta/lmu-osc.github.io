# Domain-Specific Tools to Add Later

These tools should be added to the Open Research Cycle pages when domain/data type organization is implemented.

## Collect & Manage Phase (02_collect_and_manage.qmd)

### Open Software for Running Experiments

These are discipline-specific tools, primarily for psychology/neuroscience:

| Tool | Description | Domain | URL |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **PsychoPy** | Open-source software for neuroscience/psychology experiments written in Python. Alternative to Presentation™ or Inquisit™ | Psychology, Neuroscience | https://www.psychopy.org/ |
| **PsyToolkit** | Open-source software for running online or lab-based experiments | Psychology | https://www.psytoolkit.org/ |
| **OpenSesame** | Open-source tool for building experiments with graphical interface and Python scripting. Integrates with OSF | Psychology, Neuroscience, Experimental Economics | https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/ |
| **lab.js** | Browser-based experiment builder with graphical interface. Created by Felix Henninger | Psychology, Neuroscience | https://lab.js.org/ |

### Suggested Organization

When adding domain-specific tools, consider organizing by:

1. **Data Type**
   - Survey/questionnaire data
   - Behavioral experiment data
   - Neuroimaging data
   - Physiological data
   - Interview/qualitative data

2. **Research Domain**
   - Psychology/Neuroscience
   - Social Sciences
   - Life Sciences/Biology
   - Humanities
   - Medicine/Clinical

### Implementation Notes

- Could use panel-tabset to organize by domain
- Consider adding badges like "Psychology" or "Neuroscience" to tool cards
- May want a filter/search feature if list becomes long
- Cross-reference with discipline-specific guidance in RDMkit: https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/
