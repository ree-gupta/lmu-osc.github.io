title: "4. Preserve & Share"
description: "Publish data, archive code, ensure open access articles, and obtain DOIs for citations"
phase_order: 4
sidebar: open-research-cycle
---

This final phase focuses on making your research outputs—code, data, and publications—accessible, citable, and preserved for the long term.

## Link Your Research Outputs

When prompted on repositories and article submission systems, always link your work to:

- **[ORCID](https://orcid.org/)**: Your unique researcher identifier
- **ROR ID**: Your institution's unique identifier (e.g., [LMU: https://ror.org/05591te55](https://ror.org/05591te55))
- **Funder IDs**: Grant numbers and funder ROR IDs

This ensures proper credit attribution and helps track research impact.

## a. Publish Your Code

:::

### Preparing Your Code Repository

Before making your code public:

1. **Remove sensitive data**: If working with sensitive data, create a fresh repository that never contained the data
2. **Add simulated or synthetic data**: Provide example data that allows others to run your code
3. **Update README**: Write for external users, explaining how to use the repository
4. **Add a license**: Choose an appropriate open source license (e.g., MIT, GPL)
5. **Finalize documentation**: Ensure data dictionary and README are complete

### Publishing to GitHub & Zenodo

::: {.callout-note}
## Workflow
**Private & Secure** (during research) → **Public & Citable** (at publication)

Use secure platforms (e.g., institutional GitLab) during research, then publish to public platforms when ready.
:::

**Steps:**

1. Create a **GitHub** repository with your polished code
2. Link GitHub to **Zenodo**
3. Create a **release** on GitHub
4. Zenodo automatically archives and assigns a **DOI**
5. Add the DOI to your manuscript

::: {.callout-tip}
## Timing Options
- **For reviewers**: Publish when submitting to journals that require reproducibility checks
- **At acceptance**: Publish only after manuscript acceptance
:::

### Important Checks

Before publishing:

- ✓ No sensitive information in code or history
- ✓ README written for external users
- ✓ Data dictionary finalized
- ✓ License added
- ✓ Example data included (simulated/synthetic)
- ✓ All dependencies documented

## b. Publish Your Data

::: {.callout-important}
Research data is as important as the results it produces. Sharing data enables reuse, collaboration, and verification of findings.
:::

### Data Sharing Decision Tree

Use decision tools like the [OxWIN Data Sharing Decision Tree](https://oxwin.org/) to assess if and how you can share your data.

### Open Data Repositories

**When data can be shared openly:**

- Choose a **discipline-specific repository** (find them on [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/))
- Or use subject-agnostic repositories:
  - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
  - [OSF](https://osf.io/)
  - [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)

**Requirements:**

- Complete anonymization of personal data
- Proper licensing (e.g., CC0, CC BY)
- Ethics committee approval for data sharing
- FAIR-compliant metadata

### Restricted Access Data

**When data contains sensitive information:**

Some repositories allow **metadata-only** publication with controlled data access:

- Publish comprehensive non-sensitive **metadata** (study design, methods, variables)
- Store actual data on secure institutional servers
- Provide clear **data access request procedures**
- Use Data Access Agreements (DAAs) for approved requests

::: {.callout-warning}
Consult with your institution's data protection office and ethics committee before sharing any human participant data.
:::

## c. Open Access Publications

### Green Open Access (Free Options)

Increase accessibility of your articles without paying fees:

1. **Publish conceptual figures** under CC BY 4.0 license (e.g., on OSF) so you can reuse them freely
2. **Submit a preprint** to:
   - Discipline-specific preprint servers (e.g., bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv)
   - [LMU institutional repository](https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/)
3. **Upload a postprint** (accepted manuscript version) when allowed by the journal

::: {.callout-note}
Check journal policies on [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/) or the journal's self-archiving page.
:::

### Preprint vs. Postprint

- **Preprint**: Manuscript before peer review
  - Upload at submission for early feedback
  - Update with revised versions during review

- **Postprint**: Accepted manuscript (not formatted by publisher)
  - Upload after acceptance
  - May have embargo period

- **Published version**: Final formatted article
  - Usually requires payment or special agreements
  - Request CC BY license when possible

### Gold Open Access

If paying Article Processing Charges (APCs):

- Request **CC BY license** for maximum reusability
- Check institutional agreements that may cover costs
- Contact [LMU Open Access team](mailto:open-access@ub.uni-muenchen.de) for support

## d. Lift Preregistration Embargo

If you preregistered your study with an embargo:

- Make the preregistration public
- Obtain the DOI
- Cite it in your published article

## e. Acknowledge Contributions

### CRediT Taxonomy

Use the [CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://credit.niso.org/) to specify who did what:

- Conceptualization
- Data curation
- Formal analysis
- Funding acquisition
- Investigation
- Methodology
- Project administration
- Resources
- Software
- Supervision
- Validation
- Visualization
- Writing—original draft
- Writing—review & editing

### Method Reporting with Initials for Transparency (MeRIT)

When multiple team members contribute to methods, add initials in the Methods section to identify who performed each step.

---

### Checkpoint: Manuscript Submission

Submit your manuscript with DOI links to:

- Preregistration (if applicable)
- Code repository
- Data repository or metadata record

Ensure you have consent from all co-authors for all parts of the manuscript before submission.
