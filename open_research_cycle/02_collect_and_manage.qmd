This phase covers best practices for collecting, organizing, storing, and quality-checking your research data.

## a. FAIR Data Management

::: {.callout-tip}
## Learn More
[FAIR Data Management](https://lmu-osc.github.io/FAIR-Data-Management/) (2h tutorial)
:::

Before starting to work with data, apply FAIR principles throughout your research:

- **Findable**: Assign persistent identifiers (DOIs), use searchable metadata
- **Accessible**: Make data open or accessible with clear access procedures
- **Interoperable**: Use standard terminology and stable file formats
- **Reusable**: Provide rich documentation and data usage licenses

Following these practices allows you, collaborators, and external researchers to access, understand, and reuse your data.

## b. Data Acquisition & Storage

### Standard Protocols

- Follow established protocols for data collection in your field
- Document any deviations from standard procedures
- Maintain detailed records of data collection processes

### Data Backup: The 3-2-1 Rule

For all research data, follow the **3-2-1 rule**:

- **3 copies** of the data
- **2 different media types** (e.g., external drive, cloud storage)
- **1 copy stored off-site** or on a separate location

::: {.callout-warning}
Never store research data only on personal laptops or single storage devices. Ensure regular backups to protect against data loss.
:::

### File Organization

- Use consistent, descriptive naming conventions
- Organize files in a logical directory structure
- Document your file organization system
- Transfer data regularly to secure storage locations

## c. Anonymize Your Dataset

Most research involving human participants requires careful data anonymization.

::: {.callout-important}
## Sensitive Information
Ensure all personally identifiable information (PII) is removed:
- Participant names, addresses, phone numbers
- Facial features in images
- Hidden metadata in files (e.g., DICOM, NIfTI headers)
:::

**Your responsibilities:**

- Review and test anonymization procedures
- Check tables, image files, and metadata
- Consult with your research team if unsure
- Verify (pseudo)anonymization before sharing data

Different data types may require different anonymization approaches. Always confirm that your data is properly anonymized before moving to collaborative analysis or sharing stages.

## d. Quality Control

::: {.callout-note}
## Timing
Perform quality checks **before** starting statistical analyses to exclude data points that might severely bias your results.
:::

### General QC Principles

When performing quality control, especially with team members:

1. **Train your team**: Schedule a meeting to walk everyone through QC procedures
2. **Track progress**: Use shared documents to monitor QC completion
3. **Assign tasks clearly**: Make sure everyone knows their responsibilities
4. **Review flagged cases**: Meet with the project leader to discuss questionable data points
5. **Document decisions**: Keep clear records of inclusion/exclusion criteria

### QC Documentation

Before moving forward, ensure you have:

- ✓ Data stored in the appropriate format and location
- ✓ Data sufficiently anonymized for the next stage
- ✓ Complete documentation of data acquisition
- ✓ List of all flagged subjects from QC
- ✓ Final exclusion criteria with justifications

### Domain-Specific QC

Quality control procedures vary by field and data type. For specialized data (e.g., neuroimaging, sequencing data), follow established discipline-specific QC protocols. Check with your research community for:

- Standard QC metrics
- Visualization tools
- Automated QC pipelines
- Reporting guidelines

### Checkpoint: Data Quality Validation Meeting

Meet with your team to demonstrate that your data has undergone quality checks, is properly stored and formatted, and review the final exclusion criteria.
