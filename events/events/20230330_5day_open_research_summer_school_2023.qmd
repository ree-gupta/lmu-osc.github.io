<p>The LMU Open Science Center organises this hybrid open research summer school to allow early-career researchers to gain more trust in the research that they do, and make it as credible as it can be in the eyes of their peers, the public, and funding agencies.</p><p>By joining (or accessing the material after the school), you will learn how to:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>plan your statistical plans in advance of collecting data to prevent biases in analyses, with the help of <strong>preregistration</strong> and <strong>data simulation</strong>;</li>
<li>create computationally reproducible workflows so you can be more efficient and spot mistakes in data wrangling or analyses, through <strong>programming</strong>, creating <strong>dynamic</strong> <strong>reports</strong>, and <strong>version</strong> <strong>controlling</strong> scripts;</li>
<li>share <strong>data</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, <strong>codes</strong>, and <strong>articles</strong> appropriately (using <strong>Findable</strong>, <strong>Accessible</strong>, <strong>Interoperable</strong>, <strong>Reusable</strong> <strong>principles</strong>, sensible data <strong>anonymisation</strong> <strong>techniques</strong>, adequate <strong>repositories</strong> and <strong>licences</strong>) for your research to have more impact, by allowing others to build upon or replicate your work;</li>
<li>follow <strong>guidelines to report results</strong> adequately and conduct <strong>systematic reviews</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The summer school will consist of public lectures and workshops for selected applicants.</p><p>Some keynote presenters:</p><ul>
<li>Prof Uli Dirnagl, Director of QUEST Center for Responsible Research</li>

Master students and early post docs are also welcome to apply. It will be held in a hybrid format and you will be able to choose your preferred mode of participation (online or in-person). By applying, we expect you to attend all sessions of the school (with exception possible).</p><div>
