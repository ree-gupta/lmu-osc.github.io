<!-- {{< include templates/_event_description.qmd >}} -->

<p>The Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.</p><p>While some European institutions start backing up at-risk research data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research &amp; Culture" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever</p><h2>Join the LMU Open Science Center <a href="https://safeguar.de/">Safeguar.de</a> Hackathon</h2><p><img src="hackathon.png" alt="hackathon"></p><p>At this hands-on event, we welcome Henrik Schönemann (HU Berlin), an initiator of <a href="https://safeguar.de/">safeguar.de</a>, for an ignition talk. In the practical part, we will directly support the data rescue efforts:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Learn &amp; Build</strong>: Install a BitTorrent client on your own machine to seed and safeguard critical research datasets. Scrape at-risk data sets.</li>
<li>
<strong>Repurpose Old Hardware</strong>: Turn old 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops into dedicated data rescue nodes by installing Linux and setting up archiving tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improve Tools &amp; Docs</strong>: Write better documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to simplify deployment on any system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Open to Everyone — Not Just Coders</h2><p>While some parts are technical, we welcome everyone to contribute to: Outreach, documentation, coordination, creative ideas.</p><p><em>Let’s work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.</em></p><p><strong>You can contribute to the project by ...</strong></p><ul>
<li>Donating old hardware and/or</li>
<li>Attending the Hackathon</li>
<li>participating in the discussions</li>
</ul>
