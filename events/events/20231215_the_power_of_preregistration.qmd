<p>We are excited to invite you to our fifth session this semester. The session will revolve around preregistration, and based on the paper „Reducing bias, increasing transparency and calibrating confidence with preregistration“ by Hardwicke &amp; Wagenmakers, we will discuss functions and benefits of preregistration in scientific research as well as practical challenges and related meta-research. </p><p><strong>Procedure: </strong>One member of the organising team, Julian Lange, will summarise the paper by Hardwicke &amp; Wagenmakers. There will then be an open discussion where you can contribute your own thoughts and questions. Finally, there will be time to get to know each other and talk in smaller groups.</p><p><strong>About the journal club: </strong><a href="../../meetups/reproducibilitea/index.html" title="ReproducibiliTea Journal Club">Here</a> you can find further information about the concept of the journal club.</p><p>You are cordially invited to attend our upcoming meetings!
