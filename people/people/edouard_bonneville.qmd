mission_statement:
  - I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE). For parts of 2026, I will be interim Reproducibility and Open Science Transfer Coordinator at the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML).
  - I believe the principles of Open Science are essential to increasing the transparency and reliability of biostatistical research. In my work, I strive to make full use of the computational reproducibility tools at my disposal (in the R ecosystem), and to systematically make materials such as analysis code publicly available and properly documented. As a reviewer for methodological journals, I am convinced that the sharing all code associated with a particular publication (e.g. both the code needed to implement a new method, and the one needed for running a simulation study) should be a requirement. Additionally, the sharing of a synthetic version of a particular dataset should be encouraged whenever the original data cannot be shared.
