mission_statement:
  - My lab uses a broad range of mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques to explore the ubiquitin and autophagy system.
  - Inherent to our approach, we generate a large amounts of data which we make accessible via open-access depositories. I am convinced that sharing this and other kind of files together with its respective metadata is key to accelerate scientific discoveries and ensure reproducibility. Therefore, I am interested in educating co-workers and peers to implement data sharing according to the FAIR principles.
