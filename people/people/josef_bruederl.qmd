mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Quantitative Methods and Social Inequality at the Department of Sociology.
  - Open Science has been essential for me since my first publication back in 1990 when I prepared a CD-ROM with reproducible analysis code (and wondered, why nobody asked for it). Today, my team gathers large-scale survey data (German Family Panel) which we provide to the research community as a service.
