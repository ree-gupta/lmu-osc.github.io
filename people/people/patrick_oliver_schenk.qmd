mission_statement:
  - I am a PhD student in the Faculty of Math, Informatics and Statistics at the Department of Statistics.
  - To me, “Open Science is just good science in a digital age,” as Heidi Seibold put it. I believe that statisticians, through their dual role– conducting own research and supporting researchers from other disciplines– are well-positioned to contribute meaningfully to Open Science. In teaching, collaborating with non-statisticians, and supporting colleagues, I aim to increase data and statistical literacy as well as promote good scientific practices. In my research, I strive to both implement Open Science practices myself and explore how problems, such as the reproducibility crisis, are connected to the foundations of statistics.
