mission_statement:
  - I support individual researchers in adopting best practices by making better science easier, providing tools, spreading knowledge, and reducing barriers to adoption. As a trained experimental psychologist and budding statistician, I focus on reproducibility in the data collection, analysis and archival pipeline. In the past, I have worked with colleagues in the Open Science Collaboration, on the Open Scholarship Knowledge Base, and the Psych-DS standard, among others.
