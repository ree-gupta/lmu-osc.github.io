mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Finance and Banking at the Munich School of Management.
  - I consider data transparency and replicability of scientific studies as key elements of good scientific research practices. Therefore, jointly with the ifo Institute, we have established an IT infrastructure (<a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/de/ifoHome/facts/EBDC/EBDC-Archiv.html">https://www.cesifo-group.de/de/ifoHome/facts/EBDC/EBDC-Archiv.html</a>) at LMU’s Economics and Business Data Center (EBDC) which allows interested researchers on-site access to stored data for replication purposes. The structure also allows data to be anonymized (if necessary).
