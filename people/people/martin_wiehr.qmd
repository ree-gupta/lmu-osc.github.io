mission_statement:
  - I am a Psychology student at LMU. Throughout both courses and my work as a student assistant at the Chair of Psychological Methods, I have found that the principles of open science should be fundamental to the way we conduct research. To further promote and research open science, I joined the Open Science AG from the PsyFaKo and started a programming course teaching tools for reproducibility and good coding practices.
