personal: 'As a data analyst working with a wide range of biomedical research groups at the Martinsried campus, I have been committed to promoting Open Science for more than two decades—through both collaboration and teaching. I would like to contribute to establishing the Open Science Center as a strong and visible hub for the entire university. My focus is on shaping training and support structures that accommodate diverse disciplinary needs and on fostering sustainable strategies for the long-term success of the Center.'

mission_statement:
  - I am heading the <a href="https://www.compbio.bmc.med.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html" title="About Us">Bioinformatics Core Facility at the Biomedical Center</a>, LMU.
  - Nowadays, first priority in my work as a scientist is to implement and teach reproducibility measures in basic life science. Looking back to 20 years of wet lab research I realized that I hardly ever designed an experiment properly. This is a common problem that will not be solved by top-down measures but by systematic education of new generations of scientists.<strong> </strong>
