mission_statement:
  - Being a researcher who works on funds coming from public money, I feel the responsibility to provide reproducible and transparent research knowledge that is accessible to the public. 
  - The mainstream publication processes are driven by neoliberal market logics, and besides can be inefficient, lengthy, and not assuring quality papers. With a great part of my research participants being based in South and Southeastasian regions, open accessibility of my research outcomes is imperative to me. However, open access publishing in high-ranked journals is costly and contradicts my understanding of research dissemination. 
  - I support the open science movement because I find it a great way to counter the mainstream practices of academic knowledge production and sharing.
