mission_statement:
  - Open Science is essential to enable scientists to conduct interrelated and more credible research with a set of common standards as a foundation, thus improving their own individual research. Within the Journal Club I support the process of finding new presenters as well as the discussion sessions. So far, I conduct especially preregistration, open data and materials.
