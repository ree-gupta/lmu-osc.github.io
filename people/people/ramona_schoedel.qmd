mission_statement:
  - My research is at the intersection of psychology and data-driven sciences. For my own work, it is very important to me to be transparent and to share analysis code, materials, and data (while respecting data privacy issues) to make a sustainable contribution to research in my field. In my teaching, I try to infect students with my enthusiasm for Open Science and thus to sensitize young people for Open Science.
