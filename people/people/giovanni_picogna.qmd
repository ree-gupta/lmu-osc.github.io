mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Observatory of the LMU, working on planet formation. During my career I have come to understand how essential is openness into the scientific process, and how much it can help it to spur. I work with numerical simulations to recreate observations, in order to understand the physical processes at the base of planet formation. Many details can be hidden under the carpet, both from the observational and numerical side. In my work I am trying to explain all the assumptions made during my work, and I am planning to render more public all the codes and data used during the simulations and in the post-processing phase.
