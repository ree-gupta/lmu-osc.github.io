mission_statement:
  - I am a PhD candidate at the Chair for Statistical Learning &amp; Data Science (Department of Statistics). As a statistician by training and machine learning researcher, I am painfully aware of how much good science depends on the appropriate interpretation of empirical findings. In my field, particular emphasis is put on statistical soundness and technical reproducibility. I am eager to contribute to the promotion of Open Science across the scientific community.
