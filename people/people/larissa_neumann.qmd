mission_statement:
  - I am currently a research scholar at the UC San Diego Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, USA, and a research assistant at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE), LMU, Germany. I practice anesthesiology at the Medical Center of the University of Munich (LMU Klinikum), with additional experience in critical care. In December 2018, I joined the working group Anesthesia &amp; Critical Care Informatics and Data Analysis Group (ACID).
  - My research interests are in perioperative medicine and developing predictive models for critically ill patients. In addition to exploring machine learning methods to personalize blood transfusion triggers, I am excited about being a team member of building an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) data warehouse to establish a cross-institutional distributed ledger.
  - In my current project, Reliable Response Data Discovery for COVID-19 Clinical Consults using Patient Observations, many health institutions answer COVID-19 questions by consulting, in a privacy-protecting manner, data from electronic health records. We share concept definitions, query codes, and results to allow reproducibility. 'Open Science' can be the key for impactful research.
