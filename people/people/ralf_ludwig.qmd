mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Applied Physical Geography and Environmental Modeling at the Department of Geography.
  - I specialize in analyzing the impacts of climate change on water and land resources on regional scales. While I am aware of the broad acceptance of open science principles in the climate science community, I am also witnessing a considerable lack thereof in other areas of my research domain. With many years of experience in associate editing for high-level scientific journals, I am convinced that the need for research transparency, validation, code and data sharing is more necessary than ever.
