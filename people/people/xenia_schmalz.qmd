mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy.
  - For me, openness is intrinsically linked with high quality of research. Studies with open methods, materials, and data allow other researchers to find and correct potential mistakes and build on other labs' work rather than spending time and resources on re-developing methods and ideas. I make my own research, including materials, data, and analysis scripts, publicly available. I also promote Open Science in talks at workshops and seminars. Since April 2018, I organise a monthly event called <a href="../../../../news/news31/index.html" title="Open Science Beers in Munich">Open Science Beers</a>, which aims to bring together scientists across fields for informal conversations about Open Science.
