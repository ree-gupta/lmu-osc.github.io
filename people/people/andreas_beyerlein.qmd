mission_statement:
  - I am a statistician and epidemiologist at the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Privatdozent (Adjunct Lecturer) at TU München, and Academic Editor for PLOS ONE.
  - I realized already at a very early stage of my career how scientific results can be affected by subjective / doubtful decisions made before, during or even after the data analysis process, such as lack of a clear pre-specified hypothesis, preliminary analysis during the time of data collection, data analysis without well-documented or even any program code, or p-hacking. I make my program codes publicly available, wherever possible, and in the role of a reviewer or editor, I always ask the authors of submitted papers to do likewise.
