mission_statement:
  - My primary research interests are linguistic typology and language documentation and description, and in both domains open science practices are of utmost importance. I partake in a number of initiatives that create freely accessible research and teaching resources and support open publishing by doing volunteer work. I also encourage openness and transparency in all research projects conducted at the Institute of Finno-Ugric Studies.
