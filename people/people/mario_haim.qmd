mission_statement:
  - I am professor for Communication Science, especially Computational Communication Research, at the Department of Communication and Media.
  - While various principles of Open Science are embraced more in some parts of our field, others face severe challenges. The use of third-party data, for example, or working with individuals' personal data through surveys and in-depth interviews, stands in some contrast to the unlimited sharing of data and materials. In a recent DFG-funded project, we seek to identfy such challenges and potential solutions to them.
