mission_statement:
  - I am a PhD student in statistics at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE) as part of the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML). My research interests include meta-scientific issues within the fields of statistics and machine learning, such as researcher degrees of freedom and questionable research practices in method comparison studies. In this context, I am examining how preregistration and related ideas could be adopted from applied disciplines to improve the transparency and credibility of computational methodological research.
  - I am also a co-organizer of the ReproducibiliTea journal club, where we discuss and promote Open Science, reproducibility, and related topics.
