mission_statement:
  - I believe Open Science is essential for improving transparency and reproducibility, both of which are fundamental to credible and impactful research. I care deeply about making collaboration more efficient, trackable, and inclusive—so that scientific progress becomes easier to share, verify, and build upon. I am particularly interested in helping foster practical approaches to Open Science within research teams and collaborative projects.
