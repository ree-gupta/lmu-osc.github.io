mission_statement:
  - Openness and transparency are indispensable features of scientific inquiry. If<br>taken seriously, the idea of „organized scepticism“ requires researchers to be fully transparent about<br>their arguments, data, and methods. In reality, though, too much science is conducted behind<br>closed doors. In my research, I embrace open science practices while shedding light on factors that<br>lead others (not) to do so.<br>My PhD work is part of the DFG priority program <a href="https://www.meta-rep.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">META-REP.</a> I am passionate about data<br>visualization, statistical literacy, and developing software tools that make the adoption of open<br>science practices easier.
