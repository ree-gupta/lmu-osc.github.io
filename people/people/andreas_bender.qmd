mission_statement:
  - I am a Research Associate and Lecturer at the Department of Statistics, LMU and part of the working groups <a href="https://www.stat.lmu.de/stablab/en/">Statistical Consulting Unit</a> and <a href="https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/">Statistical Learning &amp; Data Science</a>.
  - As a consultant, I try to propagate good statistical practice in the applied sciences. As an educator, I try to raise awareness and sensitivity for open science issues like p-hacking and reproducibility. In my own research, I try to adhere to open science principles whenever possible, e.g., by sharing code and data, and by making manuscripts open access.
