mission_statement:
  - In clinical psychology, Open Science, reproducibility, and replicability may still be improved. Especially sensitive clinical data requires additional steps to guarantee anonymization. I make reproducible analysis code and data available for every publication, see the "<a href="http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/">Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science</a>".
