mission_statement:
  - If data or even instruments are closed, you cannot work with them. I have often had interesting discussions in lectures about analyzing data differently. But usually you never got the data. So no further research was done. Therefore, I try to make my data, instruments, textbooks and lectures available as much as possible so that research can continue.
