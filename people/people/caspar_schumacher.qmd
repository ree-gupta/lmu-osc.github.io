mission_statement:
  - I am Caspar and I'm currently enrolled in the B.Sc Psychology program, where my academic focus and research interest lies in the realm of social- and personality psychology, as well as Open Science and Science Communication.
  - Occasionally, when time permits, I participate in the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club?a forum dedicated to discussions on crucial aspects of research methodology.
  - Collaborating with other Bsc. students, I am actively involved in the RPsyche programming course designed for psychologists. This course emphasizes the fundamental principles of clean, technology-supported research and advocates for the adoption of good coding practices within the field.
  - My academic journey is driven by a commitment to promoting rigorous research standards in psychology, combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills. Through these initiatives, I aim to contribute to the cultivation of a research community that values transparency, reproducibility, and excellence in scientific methodology.
