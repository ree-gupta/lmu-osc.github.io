mission_statement:
  - I am Professor of Macroeconomics and Public Finance at the Department of Economics, Director of the ifo Center for Macroeconomics and Surveys and in the Board of Directors of the LMU-ifo Economics &amp; Business Data Center (EBDC).
  - Replicability of empirical studies is a must for “good scientific practice”. The EBDC is offering such opportunities (<a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/EBDC/EBDC-Archiv.html">https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/EBDC/EBDC-Archiv.html</a>) and I hope that many researchers will make use of the opportunities that we offer.
