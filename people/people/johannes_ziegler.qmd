mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoc in the Social Psychology unit at LMU. My research focus is judgement and decision making in social contexts. I am part of the DFG-funded consortium "META-REP" on determinants of replicability. I am convinced that open science routines can and should be an integral component of robust, genuine, and reliable research.
