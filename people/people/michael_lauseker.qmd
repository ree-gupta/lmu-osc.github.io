mission_statement:
  - I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology.
  - Open Science is crucial for statisticians as it promotes transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility in research, ultimately enhancing the quality and impact of statistical analysis. Our field faces a delicate balance between respecting legitimate data protection interests on one hand and the ethical imperative to maximize the utilization of valuable research data on the other. I believe the Open Science Center provides the ideal framework to address these challenges.
